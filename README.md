##About this code

These are samples for meeting discussion. The rest is coming soon ...

This application will allow our members to be added to the Github group automatically. We will add features from there, for example, manual screening, checking against the meetup roster, ....

So far the app shows:
Nodejs as a proxy to the Github API.
OAuth to authenticate to a Github account.
Basic project setup and deployment (but not yet best practices).


##Goals for this project

Is it a framework? 
No, a demo and tutorial.
Maybe a quick start / boilerplate.
        
Coverage for the good fits for nodejs
API proxy
Events, streams
Workflow applications

Quality code and process, nodejs best practices

General goal: to be able to automate processes that are first done manually.


## Use Github

Please post issues for feature ideas

Also, please use issues for admin tasks.  
For example, post on the issue to get membership to the Github org.
